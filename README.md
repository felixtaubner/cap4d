TL;DR: CAP4D turns any number of reference images into an animatable avatar. 

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quick start guide

### üõ†Ô∏è 1. Create conda environment and install requirements

```bash
# 1. Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/felixtaubner/cap4d/
cd cap4d

# 2. Create conda environment for CAP4D:
conda create --name cap4d_env python=3.10
conda activate cap4d_env

# 3. Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 4. Set python path
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/cap4d:$PYTHONPATH
```
Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d/blob/main/INSTALL.md) and install Pytorch3D. Make sure to install with CUDA support. We recommend to install from source: 

```bash
export FORCE_CUDA=1
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git@stable"
```

### üì¶ 2. Download FLAME and MMDM weights
Setup your FLAME account at the [FLAME website](https://flame.is.tue.mpg.de/index.html) and set the username 
and password environment variables:
```bash
export FLAME_USERNAME=your_flame_user_name
export FLAME_PWD=your_flame_password
```

Download FLAME and MMDM weights using the provided scripts:

```bash 
# 1. Download FLAME blendshapes
# set your flame username and password
bash scripts/download_flame.sh 

# 2. Download CAP4D MMDM weights
bash scripts/download_mmdm_weights.sh
```

### ‚úÖ 3. Check installation with a test run
Run the pipeline in debug settings to test the installation.

```bash
bash scripts/test_pipeline.sh
```

Check if a video is exported to `examples/debug_output/tesla/sequence_00/renders.mp4`.
If it appears to show a blurry cartoon Nicola Tesla, you're all set! 

### üé¨ 4. Inference 
Run the provided scripts to generate avatars and animate them with a single script:

```bash
bash scripts/generate_felix.sh
bash scripts/generate_lincoln.sh
bash scripts/generate_tesla.sh
```

The output directories contain exported animations which you can view in real-time.
Open the [real-time viewer](https://felixtaubner.github.io/cap4d/viewer/) in your browser (powered by [Brush](https://github.com/ArthurBrussee/brush/)). Click `Load file` and
upload the exported animation found in `examples/output/{SUBJECT}/animation_{ID}/exported_animation.ply`.

## üîß Custom inference

See below for how to run your custom inference on your own reference images/videos and driving videos.

### ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Run FLAME 3D face tracking

#### 1.1 FlowFace tracking
Coming soon! For now, only generations using the provided identities with precomputed [FlowFace](https://felixtaubner.github.io/flowface/) annotations are supported. 

#### 1.2 Pixel3DMM tracking
Install [Pixel3DMM](https://github.com/SimonGiebenhain/pixel3dmm) using the provided script. Notice that this is prone to errors due to package version mismatches. Please report any errors as an issue!

```bash
export PIXEL3DMM_PATH="../PATH/TO/pixel3dmm"  # set this to where you would like to clone the Pixel3DMM repo (absolute path)
export CAP4D_PATH="../PATH/TO/cap4d"  # set this to the cap4d directory (absolute path)

bash scripts/install_pixel3Dmm.sh
```

Run tracking and conversion on reference images/videos using the provided script. Note: If input is a directory of frames, it is assumed to be discontinous set of (monocular!) images. If input is a file, it will assume that it is a continous monocular video.

```bash
export PIXEL3DMM_PATH=$(realpath "../PATH/TO/pixel3dmm")
export CAP4D_PATH=$(realpath "../PATH/TO/cap4d") 

# process a video
bash scripts/track_video_pixel3dmm.sh examples/input/animation/tracking_example/video.mp4 examples/input/animation/tracking_example/  # input_path (can be directory containing images or video), output_path (directory where tracking is saved)

# process a directory of images
bash scripts/track_video_pixel3dmm.sh examples/input/felix/images/cam0/ examples/input/felix_pixel3dmm/
```

Notice that results will be slightly worse than with FlowFace tracking, since the MMDM is trained with FlowFace.

### üñºÔ∏è 2. Generate images using MMDM

```bash
# Generate images with single reference image
python cap4d/inference/generate_images.py --config_path configs/generation/high_quality.yaml --reference_data_path examples/input/lincoln/ --output_path examples/output/lincoln/

# Generate images with multiple reference images
python cap4d/inference/generate_images.py --config_path configs/generation/high_quality.yaml --reference_data_path examples/input/felix/ --output_path examples/output/felix/
```
Note: the generation script will use all visible CUDA devices. The more available devices, the faster it runs! This will take hours, and requires lots of RAM (ideally > 64 GB) to run smoothly.

### üë§ 3. Fit Gaussian avatar 

```bash
python gaussianavatars/train.py --config_path configs/avatar/default.yaml --source_paths examples/output/{SUBJECT}/reference_images/ examples/output/{SUBJECT}/generated_images/ --model_path examples/output/{SUBJECT}/avatar/ --interval 5000
```

### üï∫ 4. Animate your avatar

For now, only animations with precomputed FLAME annotations are supported. 
These animations are located in `examples/input/animation/`.

```bash
python gaussianavatars/animate.py --model_path examples/output/lincoln/avatar/ --target_animation_path examples/input/animation/sequence_00/fit.npz  --target_cam_trajectory_path examples/input/animation/sequence_00/orbit.npz  --output_path examples/output/lincoln/animation_00/ --export_ply 1 --compress_ply 0
```

The `--target_animation_path` contains FLAME expressions and pose, while the (optional) `--target_cam_trajectory_path` contains the relative camera trajectory. 

### ‚ö°Ô∏è 5. Full inference

We provide a convenient script to run full inference using your reference images and optionally a driving video.
